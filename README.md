# **Java Spring Boot - Understanding Relationships & Cascading**  

## ðŸ“Œ **Overview**  
This project demonstrates different types of relationships and cascading operations in **Java Spring Boot** with **MySQL/PostgreSQL**. It helps in understanding how to implement and utilize these relationships effectively in real-world applications.  

## ðŸ”— **Types of Relationships Covered**  
1. **One-to-One** - Mapping between a single record in two entities.  
2. **One-to-Many / Many-to-One** - A single entity associated with multiple records in another entity.  
3. **Many-to-Many** - Multiple records associated bidirectionally between two entities.  
4. **Cascading Operations** - Managing dependent entity lifecycle operations automatically.  
5. **Lazy vs Eager Loading** - Optimizing entity fetching for performance.  

## âš™ **Tech Stack**  
- **Java + Spring Boot**  
- **JPA/Hibernate**  
- **MySQL / H2 Database**  
- **RESTful APIs**  

## ðŸš€ **Key Learnings**  
- Importance of different types of relationships in **database design**.  
- How cascading affects data persistence and deletion.  
- Practical implementation of **bidirectional vs unidirectional** mapping.  
- Impact of **fetch types (Lazy vs Eager)** on performance.  

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Setup**  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-link.git
   ```  
2. Configure **application.properties** with database credentials.  
3. Run the project using:  
   ```bash
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```  
4. Access APIs via **Postman** or **Swagger UI**.
